linear-algebra

linear-algebra is a Common Lisp library of numeric linear algebra routines.
It approximates the functionality present in the Basic Linear Algebra
Subroutines (BLAS) Fortran library. The objective of this project is to
generate linear algebra routines in native ANSI Common Lisp.

Use within quicklisp with (ql:quickload :linear-algebra)
